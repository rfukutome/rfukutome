				<h2> July 29th, 2015</h2>
				
				<p> Today, I started to work on my HTML skills again. The NASA ATD-1 project may be using it soon, so that it will be of use to me when the time comes. For now, I've made a very simple website, with basically no functionality. Maybe in the future I will be able to make it better and better to show off my skills. Until then, this is what it will be. Soon I will be starting up the programming of Unbound again, however I will probably just start over completely considering that I haven't played with it in awhile; We will see. Once that starts up I can start my Dev Journal to keep track of the problems that I have been facing with the project. For now all projects are on hold until I have completed several of my games - 
				<ol>
				<li>Fallout 3</li>
				<li>Naruto </li>
				<li>Legend of Korra</li>
				<li>Valkria Chronicles(Maybe)</li>
				</ol>
				I should be finished with them with in a month or two, and then production will start again. I still have to think of a name for the company...but I will cross that road when I get there. For now, I am still in the depths of the jungle. I will update again.
